# Aspect-Ratio-Calculator
I have a created a single Aspect Ratio Calculator, based after size43 films' aspect ratio calculators. In order to use the Aspect Ratio Calculator, just select which dimension input type you are using (width or height) and then select the aspect ratio (16:9 or 4:3). Simply looking at the code, it should be very simple and logical to be able to add more aspect ratios.
